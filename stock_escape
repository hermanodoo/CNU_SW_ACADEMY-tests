# this problem about selling stocks
# then we get inputs of N, M, K then A

# N: array length, M: min increment, K: the day our hero bought the stock (index 0 == day 1)
# A: array of stock prices over periods

# we are going to sell the stock when starting stock rises minimum value of M, we will sell it
# we need to find how many days it took to sell it and get MONEY!!!
# if we can sell it we print out the glorious day OR if we can't we print out 'The Day will come'

# this has two versions, first is just cropping the array and checking if there's a value bigger or equal to exit_val
