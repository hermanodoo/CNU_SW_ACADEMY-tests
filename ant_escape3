# this is version 3 of our ant_escape's
# our hero's and escape's location is arbitrary
# we have M numbers of punches to punch through walls
# on top of that we have Big Gun to smash all the walls, it's indicated as G in the maze

# for test case T, we will check indices of each of hero, exit, and Big Gun
# then crop the part containing our hero and the exit
# then see if the cropped parts have less or equal walls as our punches
# we will be able to escape if we can punch our way out

# however in case too many walls, we gotta find the Big Gun
# we will then get new cropped part of the maze between hero and Big Gun
# we will then just need enough punches to punch all the walls to the Big Gun

# at the end of the day, we will be screaming HELP! or HAHA!
