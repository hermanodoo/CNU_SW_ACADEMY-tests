# this is version 2 of our previous ant_escape2
# this time our hero's and escape's location is arbitrary
# also we have M numbers of dynamite to punch through walls


# for test case T, we will check indices of each of hero and exit
# then crop the part, starting from hero to exit in the maze
# then see if there's wall if not we will escape
# when we do escape we're happy so scream HAHA!
# if we can't we cry for HELP!
