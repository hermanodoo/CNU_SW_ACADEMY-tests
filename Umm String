# we will check if strings being inputted are Umm strings
# that is if we get the input, crop it from given indices
# we will see if it's three letter word 'Umm'
# m's have to be two at least and there could be more
# if it is we will printout YES and if no print out NO
# there are two versions of this,

# second version check if inputted indices have difference of 2
# if so we will crop the string to check if it's Umm+ string
# we will count numbers of character 'U' in the string
# next we will findall the string which starts with U then has at least 2 m following
# if each condition is 1 and multiplying both equals also 1, we will return YES if not NO
